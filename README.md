# GitHub action to pull translation files from Lokalise

GitHub action to download translation files from [Lokalise TMS](https://lokalise.com/) to your GitHub repository in the form of a pull request.

**Step-by-step tutorial covering the usage of this action is available on [Lokalise Developer Hub](https://developers.lokalise.com/docs/github-actions).** To upload translation files from GitHub to Lokalise, use the [lokalise-push-action](https://github.com/lokalise/lokalise-push-action).

## Usage

Use this action in the following way:

```yaml
name: Demo pull with tags

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Pull from Lokalise
        uses: lokalise/lokalise-pull-action@v3.7.0
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.LOKALISE_API_TOKEN }}
          project_id: LOKALISE_PROJECT_ID
          base_lang: en
          translations_path: |
            TRANSLATIONS_PATH1
            TRANSLATIONS_PATH2
          file_format: json
          additional_params: |
            --indentation=2sp
            --export-empty-as=skip
            --export-sort=a_z
            --replace-breaks=false
            --language-mapping=[{"original_language_iso":"en_US","custom_language_iso":"en-US"}]
```

### Important note on Lokalise filenames and tags

Before running this action, ensure that your translation keys on Lokalise are correctly assigned with appropriate [filenames](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2281317-filenames) and [tags](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1475552-tags).

#### Tags and branch context

If you are running this action from the `hub` branch on GitHub, the action will download only the keys that have the `hub` tag assigned. If no such keys are found, the action will halt execution.

#### Filenames and directory structure

If you specify `locales` as the `translations_path`, your keys must include filenames that align with this structure, such as:

- `locales/%LANG_ISO%.json`
- `locales/%LANG_ISO%/main.xml`

Here:

- `%LANG_ISO%` will be replaced with the language code (e.g., `en`, `fr`, etc.).

If the filenames do not include the correct directory prefix (like `locales/`), the action will fail to compare the downloaded files with the existing files in your `translations_path`. In this case, the workflow logs will show the message: "No changes detected in translation files.".

To avoid this, double-check that your Lokalise filenames match the expected directory structure.

## Configuration

You'll need to provide some parameters for the action. These can be set as environment variables, secrets, or passed directly. Refer to the [General setup](https://developers.lokalise.com/docs/github-actions#general-setup-overview) section for detailed instructions.

### Mandatory parameters

- `api_token` — Lokalise API token with read/write permissions.
- `project_id` — Your Lokalise project ID.
- `translations_path` — One or more paths to your translation files. For example, if your translations are stored in the `locales` folder at the project root, use `locales`. Defaults to `locales`.
- `file_format` — Defines the format of your translation files, such as `json` for JSON files. Defaults to `json`. This format determines how translation files are processed and also influences the file extension used when searching for them. However, some specific formats, such as `json_structured`, may still be downloaded with a generic `.json` extension. If you're using such a format, make sure to set the `file_ext` parameter explicitly to match the correct extension for your files.
- `base_lang` — Your project base language, such as `en` for English. Defaults to `en`.

### File and CLI options

- `async_mode` — Download translations in asynchronous mode. Not recommended for small projects but required for larger ones (>= 10 000 key-language pairs). Defaults to `false`.
- `file_ext` — Custom file extension to use when searching for translation files (without leading dot). By default, the extension is inferred from the `file_format` value. However, for certain formats (e.g., `json_structured`), the downloaded files may still have a generic extension (e.g., `.json`). In such cases, this parameter allows specifying the correct extension manually to ensure proper file matching.
- `additional_params` — Extra parameters to pass to the [Lokalise CLI when pulling files](https://github.com/lokalise/lokalise-cli-2-go/blob/main/docs/lokalise2_file_download.md). For example, you can use `--indentation=2sp` to manage indentation. Defaults to an empty string. Multiple params can be specified:

```yaml
additional_params: |
  --indentation=2sp
  --export-empty-as=skip
  --export-sort=a_z
  --replace-breaks=false
  --language-mapping=[{"original_language_iso":"en_US","custom_language_iso":"en-US"}]
```

- `flat_naming` — Use flat naming convention. Set to `true` if your translation files follow a flat naming pattern like `locales/en.json` instead of `locales/en/file.json`. Defaults to `false`.
- `skip_include_tags` — Skip setting the `--include-tags` argument during download. This will download all translation keys for the specified format, regardless of tags.
- `skip_original_filenames` — Skips setting the `--original-filenames` and `--directory-prefix` arguments during download. You can disable original filenames by setting `--original-filenames=false` explicitly via `additional_params`.

### Git configuration

- `git_user_name` — Optional Git username to use when committing changes. If not provided, the action will default to the GitHub actor associated with the workflow run. Useful if you want to use a specific name (e.g. "Localization Bot") in your commit history.
- `git_user_email` — Optional Git email address to associate with commits. If not set, it defaults to a noreply address based on the Git username (e.g. `username@users.noreply.github.com`). This is helpful for cleaner commit metadata or if you want to associate commits with a bot/user email.

### Pull request and GitHub options

- `custom_github_token` — Optional GitHub token to use when creating or updating the pull request. If not provided, the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used. This can be helpful when your workflow requires elevated permissions (e.g., assigning reviewers, interacting with protected branches, or writing outside the current repo). Make sure to keep this token secret.
- `pr_labels` — Comma-separated list of labels to apply to the created pull request.
- `override_branch_name` — Optional static branch name to use instead of auto-generating one. This is useful if you want the action to update the same pull request across multiple runs (e.g., always syncing to `lokalise-sync`). If the branch already exists, it will be checked out and updated instead of creating a new one.
- `force_push` — Whether to force push changes to the remote branch. Useful when using a static branch name and you want to overwrite any previous state (e.g., updating an existing PR). Set to `true` with caution, as this will overwrite history. Defaults to `false`.

### Behavior tweaks and retries

- `temp_branch_prefix` — A prefix for the temporary branch used to create the pull request. For example, using `lok` will result in a branch name starting with `lok`. Defaults to `lok`.
- `always_pull_base` — By default, changes in the base language translation files (defined by the `base_lang` option) are ignored when checking for updates. Set this option to `true` to include changes in the base language translations in the pull request. Defaults to `false`.
- `max_retries` — Maximum number of retries on rate limit errors (HTTP 429). Defaults to `3`.
- `sleep_on_retry` — Number of seconds to sleep before retrying on rate limit errors. Defaults to `1`.
- `download_timeout` — Timeout for the download operation, in seconds. Defaults to `120`.

### Platform support

- `os_platform` — Target platform for the precompiled binaries used by this action (`linux_amd64`, `linux_arm64`, `mac_amd64`, `mac_arm64`). These binaries handle tasks like downloading and processing translations. Typically, you don't need to change this, as the default (`linux_amd64`) works for most environments. Override if running on a macOS runner or a different architecture.

### GitHub permissions

1. Go to your repository's **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Actions > General**.
3. Under **Workflow permissions**, set the permissions to **Read and write permissions**.
4. Enable **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** on the same page (under "Choose whether GitHub Actions can create pull requests or submit approving pull request reviews").

## Technical details

### Outputs

This action has the following outputs:

- `created_branch` — The name of the branch that was created and used for the pull request. Empty if no branch has been created (for example, if no changes have been detected).
- `pr_created` — A boolean value specifying whether a pull request with translation updates was created. False when there are no changes or something went wrong.
- `pr_number` —  Number of the created pull request.
- `pr_id` — ID of the created pull request.

For example:

```yaml
- name: Debug
  run: |
    echo "Branch created: ${{ steps.lokalise-pull.outputs.created_branch }}"
    echo "PR created: ${{ steps.lokalise-pull.outputs.pr_created }}"
    echo "PR id: ${{ steps.lokalise-pull.outputs.pr_id }}"
    echo "PR number: ${{ steps.lokalise-pull.outputs.pr_number }}"
```

### How this action works

When triggered, this action follows these steps:

1. **Install Lokalise CLIv2**:
   - Ensures that the required Lokalise CLI is available for subsequent operations.

2. **Download translation files**:
   - Retrieves translation files for all languages from the specified Lokalise project.
   - The downloaded keys are filtered by the tag corresponding to the triggering branch. For example, if the branch is named `lokalise-hub`, only keys tagged with `lokalise-hub` in Lokalise will be included in the download bundle.

3. **Detect changes**:
   - Compares the downloaded translation files against the repository’s existing files to detect any updates or modifications.

4. **Create a pull request**:
   - If changes are detected, the action creates a pull request from a temporary branch to the triggering branch.
   - The temporary branch name is constructed using the prefix specified in the `temp_branch_prefix` parameter.

For more information on assumptions, refer to the [Assumptions and defaults](https://developers.lokalise.com/docs/github-actions#assumptions-and-defaults) section.

### Default parameters for the pull action

By default, the following command-line parameters are set when downloading files from Lokalise:

- `--token` — Derived from the `api_token` parameter.
- `--project-id` — Derived from the `project_id` parameter.
- `--format` — Derived from the `file_format` parameter.
- `--original-filenames` — Set to `true`.
- `--directory-prefix` — Set to `/`.
- `--include-tags` — Set to the branch name that triggered the workflow.

## Special notes and known issues

* If you are using Gettext (PO files) and the action opens pull requests when no translations have been changed and the only difference is the "revision date", [refer to the following comment for clarifications](https://github.com/lokalise/lokalise-pull-action/issues/9#issuecomment-2578225342)
